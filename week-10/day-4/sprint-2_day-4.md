## Tasks Completed In The Session
1.Created an installer.exe for installing required modules and created .addin files in revit (2 hours) plus a readme.txt  
2.Spent a Long time(5 long hours) trying to implement generated images for each project for the UI before ultimatly scraping the whole thing  
3.Added the ability to delete Chat logs (1 hour)  
4.Bug Fixes  

## Problems In This Session
1.geting revits thumbnail data from its files to display in a electron webpage is damn near impossible as far as i can tell, so we removed the whole feature, mercifully it was not in any way part of the clients specification and was purely graphical.
